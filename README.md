Data and Scripts for *Molecular analyses reveal consistent food web structure with elevation in rainforest Drosophila - parasitoid communities*  

## Contents:

- `Scripts/` - R scripts for data preparation steps and to generate all analyses.
  + SI 0 Data preparation script, handling raw observations and generates networks and bootstrapped samples
  + SI 1 Information on sites
  + SI 3 Statistical analyses, including results presented in the main text
  + NB SI 2 details the molecular methods used for the identifications and is a standalone word document.

- `Data/` -  .csv tables detailing sequences, sites, parasitoid naming system, interactions and temperatures at sites.
- `Figures/` - Empty, but would be populated by running documents in /Scripts/
- `Images/` Illustrative photos used in SI. 
- `GeneratedData/` - Processed R data files, output by SI 0 document, to be read by SI 1 and SI 3 documents. Includes bootstraps of quantitative networks.
